# Issues & Bugs

## Issues
- I chose to keep all functions separate and easier to read. This triggered an ESlint warning: src/App.js
Line 24:7:  React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'filterHandler' and 'saveLocalTodos'.
- I attempted to create an editHandler function to edit created tasks, but couldn't get it to work.

## Bugs
N/A
